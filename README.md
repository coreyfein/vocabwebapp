# Who is this for?

People who read a lot and want to actually learn the words they look up.

I come across new words often -- reading the news, books, or even doing crossword puzzles -- and am often frustrated to find that I forget what they mean by the time I see them next. I created Vocab for Readers as a way to build my vocabulary with the words I discover organically.

When you quiz yourself here, your answers (either correct or incorrect) are stored and used to determine which words to surface on your next quiz. By noting the context in which you've disovered each word, you'll find that they stick much more easily. Each time you're quizzed on a word, you'll be reminded of exactly where you first found it.
