    <h3>Adding words</h3>
    <p>
        Using it is simple. When you come across a word you don't know, add it to your list just by following a few quick steps. 
        We'll handle retrieving the definition, synonyms, examples, etymology, and 
        You can add just the word, or you can also add the word within the sentence where you discovered it, 
        and/or a description of the work as a whole (e.g. "An article in the NYT about monarch butterflies").
        Including all three is a unique and effective way to remember a word's meaning -- and fun to look back on as your vocab list grows.

        See below for instructions on how to add a word from your phone or computer. If you already have a vocab list, you can upload it <a href="{% url 'simplevocab:vocab_list_upload' %}">here</a>.

        Quizzes
    </h3>
    <p>
        Once you've added some words to your list, the next step is to quiz yourself. 
        Each quiz contains 10-15 words, depending on how many you've added recently that you haven't been quizzed on yet.
        For each word in the quiz, think about whether you know what it means. 
        Then, click a button to show the definition, synonyms, etc, and choose "Correct" if you got it right. 
        Only mark it correct if you're confident that you really know it -- you should be able to use it in a sentence, not just have the definition memorized.
        We'll use your quiz results to help decide what to quiz you on next.

        Soon, you'll be able to sign up for email reminders linking to your next quiz (and at some point, you'll be able to customize the frequency).
