    <h3>Who is this for?</h3>    
    <p>People who read a lot and want to actually learn the words they look up.</p>
    <p>
        I come across new words often -- reading the news, books, or even doing crossword puzzles -- 
        and am often frustrated to find that I forget what they mean by the time I see them next.
        I created Vocab for Readers as a way to build my vocabulary with the words I discover organically.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you quiz yourself here, your answers (either correct or incorrect) are stored and used to determine which words to surface on your next quiz.
        By noting the context in which you've disovered each word, you'll find that they stick much more easily. 
        Each time you're quizzed on a word, you'll be reminded of exactly where you first found it.
    </p>
    <p>
        As odd as it might sound, I think this makes the words in your list special -- meaningful in a way that they just wouldn't be if they had been given to you by someone else.
    </p>
    <h3>Adding words</h3>
    <p>
        If you already have a vocab list that you'd like to build off of, you can upload it <a href="{% url 'simplevocab:vocab_list_upload' %}">here</a>.
    </p>
        When you come across a word you don't know, you'll add it to your list by entering: 
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>The word</li>
        <li>Discovery Source: Where you found the word (e.g. "An article in the NYT about monarch butterflies")</li>
        <li>Discovery Context: The sentence in which you found the word. If you use the Shortcut as outlined below, this is simple to include. 
    </ul>  
   
    <p>
        We'll handle retrieving the definition, synonyms, examples, and etymology.</p>
    <p>    

    <p>
        See below for instructions on how to add a word from your computer or phone. If you read on an Apple device, you'll find that adding a word is particularly easy.
    </p>

    <h4>
        iPhone
    </br>
    </h4>

    <p>The Vocab for Readers Shortcut makes it even easier to add words to your list. No need to open a tab in a browser -- 
        just copy the sentence and tap the icon on your home screen. </p></br>

    <h5>Setup</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>On your iPhone, download the <a href="https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/c95ed76fbaec4f889a44cc0e5018aa56" download>Vocab for Readers Shortcut</a>.</li>
        <li>Tap "Add Shortcut" on the bottom of your screen. This will open up your Shortcuts app, which comes pre-installed on every iPhone by default. If you've deleted the Shortucts app, you'll be prompted to reinstall it.</li>
        <li>Tap the three-dot menu at the top right of the Shortcut you just installed ("Vocab For Readers"). This will open up the Shortcut.</li>
        <li>At the bottom of your screen, click the share button.</li>
        <li>Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen" and then confirm by tapping "Add" at the top right.</li>
    </ol>
    </br>

    <h5>Adding a Word</h5>

    <p>When adding your first word, make sure to <a href="{% url 'login' %}">login</a> first.  

    <p>If you were reading on your phone when you came across the word:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Select and copy the sentence that includes the word you'd like to add.</li>
        <li>Go to your home screen and tap the icon for the VocabForReaders Shortcut: <img class="inline-icon" src="{% static 'simplevocab/vocab_for_readers_icon.png' %}"></li>
        <li>When prompted, enter where you discovered the word.</li>
        <li>When prompted, choose "Copied the word in context" if you copied the word within a sentence; choose "Copied just the word" if you only copied the word.</li>
        <li>When prompted, enter the word.</li>
        <li>The first time you submit those responses, you'll see a popup asking if you'd like to allow the shortcut to open your browser. Choose "Always Allow."</li>
        <li>This will open up your web browser to the <a href="{% url 'simplevocab:vocabentry_create' %}">Add a Word</a> page, with the discovery context and discovery source pre-filled.</li>
        <li>Select the word from the dropdown menu in the "Word" field, or type it in.</li>
        <li>Submit the form.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>If you were <em>not</em> reading on your phone when you came across the word, the Shortcut is still a good way to add it. Follow these steps:<p> 
    <ol>
        <li>Go to your home screen and tap the icon for the VocabForReaders Shortcut: <img class="inline-icon" src="{% static 'simplevocab/vocab_for_readers_icon.png' %}"></li>
        <li>When prompted, enter where you discovered the word.</li>
        <li>When prompted, select "Didn't copy anything."</li>
        <li>The first time you submit those responses, you'll see a popup asking if you'd like to allow the shortcut to open your browser. Choose "Always Allow."</li>
        <li>This will open up your web browser to the <a href="{% url 'simplevocab:vocabentry_create' %}">Add a Word</a> page, with your discovery source filled in.</li>
        <li>Enter the discovery context.</li>
        <li>Select the word from the dropdown menu in the "Word" field, or type it in.</li>
        <li>Submit the form.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>
        Quizzes
    </h3>
    <p>
        Once you've added some words to your list, the next step is to quiz yourself. 
        Each quiz contains up to 15 words, depending on how many are in your list and how many you've added recently.
    </p>
    <p>
        For each word in the quiz, think about whether you know what it means. 
        Then, click the button to show the definition, synonyms, etc, and choose "Correct" if you got it right. Either way, take a moment to study the word.
        Only mark it correct if you're confident that you really know it -- you should be able to use it in a sentence, not just have the definition memorized.
    </p>
    <p>
        We'll use your quiz results to help decide what to quiz you on next.
    </p>
    <p>
        Soon, you'll be able to sign up for email reminders linking to your next quiz (and at some point, you'll be able to customize the frequency).
    </p>

    <h3>
        View your vocab list

    <p>
        Your <a href="{% url 'simplevocab:all_vocabentries' %}">vocab list</a> shows all the words you've added along with stats showing how well you know them.
    </p>
    <p>
        While we try to retrieve synonyms, examples, and etymology for every word you add, sometimes it's not possible. 
        You might also want to slightly edit the data we retrieve (e.g. adding another synonym to the ones we found). 
        To update the vocab entry, click the "Update" button next to the word and follow the instructions on the page.
