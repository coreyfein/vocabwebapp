First time building (?) the container: 
docker compose run django django-admin startproject vocabwebapp .

(If starting over, after running that again, may need to do docker compose down and then docker compose up afterwards to clear the error)

After the first time, just do:
docker compose up 

To shut down the container:

In the Terminal where you did docker compose up, do ctrl+c to stop, and then:

docker compose down

To go into a bash instance within the Django conatiner:
docker exec -it vocabwebapp_django bash

Then migrate if needed:
python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb

OR 

To run something (like migrate) in the Django container without going into it first:
docker compose run django python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb



Create a superuser:
python manage.py createsuperuser

Load db data:
python manage.py loaddata datadump_2024-03-08.json

To go into the postgres db in Terminal:
docker exec -it pgdb psql -U postgres
